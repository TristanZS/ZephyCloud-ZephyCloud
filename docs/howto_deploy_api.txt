HOWTO: Deploy a new API Server
==============================


1) Get root access to this server.


2) Create a user to keep root access. 
Ensure you can connect through ssh and sudo.


3) Secure the server. For example:
- install fail2ban
- allow only ssh connection via asymetric keys
- remove ubuntu user
- install a firewall if required 
  (in this case, allow ports 22, 80 and 443)


4) Configure your DNS (see GANDI's DNS configuration page).
Warning: This change can be not affective before 3 hours


5) If you will use a new AWS region, please configure a new 
IAM 'OmegaZ' account on AWS, and store the access keys in configs files
See amazon_rights.txt for more details


6) Copy the ZephyCLOUD/API folder on the server


7) Run the install/install.sh script on the new server
WARNING: This script need the DNS change to be entirely propagated.
(because of https certificate)


8) Copy the ssh keys located in ZephyCLOUD/KEYS to 
/home/zephyserver/.ssh and ensure correct permissions and owners


9) Launch 'sudo restart_api'

10) Enjoy ... Arfff No...
In fact, there probably will be some issues, so test and test again


11) Now you can Enjoy ^^
